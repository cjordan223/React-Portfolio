# My Portfolio

  
Code for my portfolio.

  

**If you're here from my portfolio you can go back [now](https://connerjordan.com/#/about), or read a little more about the site.** 

  

## Features

  

-  **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works on all devices. Component architecture was kept in mind throughout, but some hard coding was unavoidable in certain cases.

-  **Project Showcase**: Displays various projects with descriptions, images, and links to GitHub repositories and live demos. 



-  **Archives**: Includes a section for archived coursework and projects. Probably the most time-intensive piece of the site, especially spinning up old projects and getting them up on the site.


  

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: React components for faster and easier web development.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting for the live site.
- **Cloudflare**: CDN and DNS management for improved security and performance optimization.
- **Self-Hosting**: Custom configuration and management of server resources and domain, including security, backups, and performance monitoring.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting for the live site.
